## Coordinated-Multi-Agent-Imitation-Learning

Toronto Raptors had created a ghosting system that would help coaching staff to analyze defend plays better. The game is recorded by camera system above the arena, staff would mark the position of they player where they thought the player should have been and this is the ghost of the player. However, this involves a lot of mannual annotations. In the coordinated multi-agent imitation learning, a data driven method was proposed. (For more details of the Raptors' ghosting system see [Lights, Cameras, Revolution](http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/)). 

So in this repo we attempt to implement the paper [Coordinated-Multi-Agent-Imitation-Learning
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03121.pdf) (or [Sloan version](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20170228130457/Data-Driven-Ghosting-using-Deep-Imitation-Learning-Paper1.pdf)) with Tensorflow. 

### Data
The update-to-date data is proprietary, but we found a tracking and play-by-play data for 42 Toronto Raptors games
played in Fall 2015 on this [link](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/courses/CSC2541_Winter17/project_2.pdf). We will use this data for our implementation.
